This project consists, for now, of two web pages I've designed from scratch using only HTML and CSS. These webpages are FRONTEND only. 
They are nearly 1:1 replicas of the home pages of the popular websites X and Youtube. I'm proud of these two projects as they showcase my mastery of HTML and CSS adequately.
I'm currently learning javascript and I will periodically update these projects with knowledge I've obtained of javascript.
These projects are COMPLETED and will only be updated with JavaScript depending on my schedule as I plan to start other projects which will also be uploaded here.
THANK YOU!

NOTES: Credits for icons and images will be included in a ReadMe located within the individual folders.
